About
===============================================================================

My name is Matthew Baca, and I am a PhD student studying statistics at the University of Wisconsin.  I got my Bachelor of Science (BS) in Mathematics from the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (NMT) and my Master of Science (MS) in Biostatistics from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.  For three years I worked for the Navy at China Lake, where I was doing statistical analysis and tool development in the world of Modeling and Simulation (M&S).  At China Lake I had developed several interests in data science and statistics.

Currently my interest include: (1) Design of Experiments, (2) incorporating statistical rigor to the Verification and Validation (V&V) process, (3) time series analysis, (4) tool/software development, and (5) mixed effects/regression modeling.

Of the many topics in data science, "causal inference", is a common term that I keep hearing about.  Other than "X causes Y" I do not know much about causal inference, and I would like to learn more.  I would like to learn about causal inference because I am interested in its application to computer models and simulations.

**Problem**

In the, [Assessing Time-Varying Causal Effect Moderation in Mobile Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6241330/), paper, the authors wanted to know if the use of Mobile Health (mHealth) interventions over time can help reduce heavy drinking and smoking among college students.  Being able to curb the urge to drink heavily and/or smoke among students is important to help them not only be healthy but also prematurely prevent any alcohol and cigarette addictions.

**Variables**

Here is our treatment effect is $A_t$.  When, $A_t = 1$, then a mindfulness message is provided at the $t$ th treatment occasion, otherwise $A_t = 0$.  We also have $\bar{A_t} = (A_1, â€¦, A_t)$ which includes a sequence of random variables or realized values up to a specific treatment occasion.  The "bar" notation can be applied to other variables, $X$ and $Y$.  The response variable is, $Y_{t+1}$, which is the smoking rate between the occasion $t$ self-report and the following self-report.  The variable, $X_t$, contains summaries of previous measurements of context.  $X_t$ includes the time of day, number of reports recently completed, prior smoking rate, current need to self-regulate, baseline smoking severity, baseline drinking level, age, gender, and other summary variables formed from the reports up to and including the $t$ th occasion.  Lastly we have our history variable, $H_t = (\bar{X}_t, \bar{Y}_t, \bar{A}_{t - 1})$, which is our information accrued up to treatment occasion $t$.

**Causal Effects**

Our first causal effect is,

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y_{t + 1}(\bar{A}_{t - 1}, 1) - Y_{t + 1}(\bar{A}_{t - 1}, 0) | S_{1t}(\bar{A}_{t - 1})]
$$

where $S_{1t}(\bar{A}_{t - 1})$ is a vector of summary variables chosen from $H_t(\bar{A}_{t - 1})$.  This causal effect represents the difference between effect of $A_t = 1$ (mindfulness message treatment) versus $A_t = 0$ on the smoking rate response at $t + 1$ given $S_{1t}(\bar{A}_{t - 1})$.  Here, $S_{1t}(\bar{A}_{t - 1})$, addresses a variety of scientific questions.

The next causal effect incorporates lagged effects.  Lagged effects are delayed treatment effects on our smoking rate response.  Below is the lagged causal effect,

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y_{t + k}(\bar{A}_{t - 1}, 1, A_{t + 1}^{a_t = 1}, ..., A_{t + k - 1}^{a_t = 1}) - Y_{t + k}(\bar{A}_{t - 1}, 0, A_{t + 1}^{a_t = 0}, ..., A_{t + k - 1}^{a_t = 0}) | S_{kt}(\bar{A}_{t  - 1})]
$$

where, $A_{t + 1}^{a_t = a} = A_{t + 1}(\bar{A}_{t - 1}, a)$ is the first lagged effect, $A_{t + 2}^{a_t = a} = A_{t + 2}(\bar{A}_{t - 1}, a, A_{t + 1}^{a_t = a})$ is the second lagged effect and so on.  Here there are a total of $k$ lagged effects.

**Hypothesis**

The hypothesis here is that mindfulness message treatments over time will curb college students heavy drinking and smoking rates.

**SWIG**

Below is a SWIG diagram/relationship graph between the variables, $A_t, X_t,$ and $Y_t$.  This diagram is for the first three time points, $t = (1, 2, 3)$.  For the remainder of this project we will only consider these first three time points.

**Assumptions**

Our first assumption is that there is exchangeability, i.e. $Y(a) \perp \!\!\! \perp A$ for $a \in A$.  We can make this assumption because knowing that person $i$ has been assigned treatment $a = 1$ gives no information on the smoking rate, $Y$, of person $j$ who has been assigned to treatment $a = 0$.  The assumption of SUTVA where that $a \mapsto Y(a)$ is well defined is also being made.  We can make this assumptions because we are assuming that $a = 1$ reduces smoking rate $Y(a)$ while $a = 0$ does not.  The assumption of positivity $\mathbb{P}(A = a) \in (0, 1)$ is also being made.  We can make this assumption because our subjects are being assigned the mindfullness treatment or not i.e. $a = 1$ or $a = 0$.  

The assumption of conditional positivity is also being made where $\mathbb{P}(A = a | S) \in (0, 1)$, where $S$ is a function of the previous, $A,X$ and $Y$ variables.  The assumption of conditional exchangeability i.e. $A \perp \!\!\! \perp Y(a)|S$ is also being made.  Lastly the assumption of $\mathbb{P}(S) > 0$ is being made sense the histories of $A, X,$ and $Y$ are all non zero.

**Theorem 3.1**
Given positivity, SUTVA, and exchangeability, then

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y(a)] = \mathbb{E}[Y|A = a]
$$

**Theorem 3.2**
Assume conditional positivity, conditional exchangeability, and $\mathbb{P}(X \in C) > 0$, then

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y(a) | X \in C] = \mathbb{E}[Y | A = a, X \in C]
$$

**Identification**

Identification will be done for the first three time points, $t$, on the following casual effect,

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[Y_{t+1}(\bar{A}_{t-1}, 1) - Y_{t+1}(\bar{A}_{t-1}, 0) | S_t(\bar{A}_{t-1})]
\end{equation}


where $S_t$ is a function of $A_{t-1}, X_{t-1},$ and $Y_{t-1}$.

***Case 1:***

For $t = 1$ our casual effect becomes,

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[Y_2(1) - Y_2(0)|S_1]
\end{align*}

From SUTVA and Theorem 3.1 we get,

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[Y_2(1) - Y_2(0)|S_1] = \mathbb{E}[Y_1|S_1, A_1 = 1] - \mathbb{E}[Y_2|S_1, A_1 = 0]
\end{align*}

***Case 2:***

For $t = 2$ our casual effect becomes,

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[Y_3(a_1, 1) - Y_2(a_1, 0)|S_2]
\end{align*}

We can then get,

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[Y_3(a_1, 1)|S_2] = \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[Y_3(a_1, 1)|S_2, X_2(a_1), Y_2(a_1)]]
\end{align*}

setting $g(X_2(a_1), Y_2(a_1))= \mathbb{E}[Y_3(a_1, 1)|S_2, X_2(a_1), Y_2(a_1)]$

By Theorem 3.1 our effect becomes,

\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[g(X_2(a_1), Y_2(a_1))] = \mathbb{E}[g(X_2, Y_2)| A_1 = a_1]
\end{align}

By Theorem 3.2 our $g(X_2(a_1), Y_2(a_1))$ becomes,

\begin{align*}
g(X_2(a_1), Y_2(a_1)) &= g(x, y) \\
&= \mathbb{E}[Y_3(a_1, 1)|S_2, X_2(a_1) = x, Y_2(a_1) = y] \\
&= \mathbb{E}[Y_3|S_2, X_2(a_1) = x, Y_2(a_1) = y, A_1 = a_1, A_2 = 1]
\end{align*}

Plugging this back into (3) we then get,

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[Y_3(a_1, 1)|S_2] = \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[Y_3|S_2, X_2, Y_2, A_1 = a_1, A_2 = 1]| A_1 = a_1]
\end{align*}

Similar we can get,

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[Y_3(a_1, 0)|S_2] = \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[Y_3|S_2, X_2, Y_2, A_1 = a_1, A_2 = 0]| A_1 = a_1]
\end{align*}

Via SUTVA and Theorem 3.2 our casual effect becomes,

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[Y_3(a_1, 1) - Y_3(a_1, 0)|S_2] &= \mathbb{E}[Y_3(a_1, 1)|S_2] - \mathbb{E}[Y_3(a_1, 0)|S_2] \\
&= \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[Y_3|S_2, X_2, Y_2, A_1 = a_1, A_2 = 1]| A_1 = a_1] - \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[Y_3|S_2, X_2, Y_2, A_1 = a_1, A_2 = 0]| A_1 = a_1]
\end{align*}

***Case 3:***

For $t = 3$ our casual effect becomes,

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[Y_4(a_1, a_2, 1) - Y_4(a_1, a_2, 0)|S_3]
\end{align*}

We can then get,

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[Y_4(a_1, a_2, 1)|S_3] = \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[Y_4(a_1, a_2, 1)|S_3, X_3(a_1, a_2), Y_3(a_1, a_2)]]
\end{align*}

setting $g(X_3(a_1, a_2), Y_3(a_1, a_2))= \mathbb{E}[Y_3(a_1, a_2, 1)|S_3, X_3(a_1, a_2), Y_3(a_1, a_2)]$

By Theorem 3.1 our effect becomes,

\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[g(X_3(a_1, a_2), Y_3(a_1, a_2))] = \mathbb{E}[g(X_3, Y_3)| A_1 = a_1, A_2 = a_2]
\end{align}

By Theorem 3.2 our $g(X_3(a_1, a_2), Y_3(a_1, a_2))$ becomes,

\begin{align*}
g(X_3(a_1, a_2), Y_3(a_1, a_2)) &= g(x, y) \\
&= \mathbb{E}[Y_4(a_1, a_2, 1)|S_3, X_3(a_1, a_2) = x, Y_3(a_1, a_2) = y] \\
&= \mathbb{E}[Y_4|S_3, X_3(a_1, a_2) = x, Y_3(a_1, a_2) = y, A_1 = a_1, A_2 = a_2, A_3 = 1]
\end{align*}

Plugging this back into (3) we then get,

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[Y_4(a_1, a_2, 1)|S_3] = \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[Y_4|S_3, X_3, Y_3, A_1 = a_1, A_2 = a_2, A_3 = 1]| A_1 = a_1, A_2 = a_2]
\end{align*}

Similar we can get,

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[Y_4(a_1, a_2, 0)|S_3] = \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[Y_4|S_3, X_3, Y_3, A_1 = a_1, A_2 = a_2, A_3 = 0]| A_1 = a_1, A_2 = a_2]
\end{align*}

Via SUTVA and Theorem 3.2 our casual effect becomes,

\begin{align*}
&\mathbb{E}[Y_4(a_1, a_2, 1) - Y_4(a_1, a_2, 0)|S_3] \\
&= \mathbb{E}[Y_4(a_1, a_2, 1)|S_3] - \mathbb{E}[Y_4(a_1, a_2, 0)|S_3] \\
&= \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[Y_4|S_3, X_3, Y_3, A_1 = a_1, A_2 = a_2, A_3 = 1]| A_1 = a_1, A_2 = a_2] \\
&- \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[Y_4|S_3, X_3, Y_3, A_1 = a_1, A_2 = a_2, A_3 = 0]| A_1 = a_1, A_2 = a_2]
\end{align*}
